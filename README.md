## Introduction of Minimax

Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario.Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory. Applied in two player games, such as tic-tac-toe, chess, go etc. The algorithm works recursively, delivers an optimal move for the player.
